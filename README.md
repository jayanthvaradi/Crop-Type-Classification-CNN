Crop Type Classification using Deep Learning CNN Models
This project presents a deep learning-based approach for the image classification of cereal crop types using various pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The objective was to classify images of Finger Millet, Maize, Pearl Millet, and Sorghum into their respective categories with high accuracy and generalization performance.

Models Used :
AlexNet

VGG16

ResNet18

DenseNet121

EfficientNet-B0

GoogLeNet

Results Summary :
Each model was evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy on both validation and test datasets.

EfficientNet-B0 achieved 100% accuracy on both validation and test sets.

DenseNet121 and GoogLeNet also delivered near-perfect classification performance.

ResNet18 showed strong generalization with 99% accuracy.

AlexNet and VGG16 performed well but were slightly outperformed by the newer architectures.

Key Takeaway :
EfficientNet-B0 demonstrated superior performance in learning fine-grained features and generalizing across unseen data, making it the best model for crop type classification in this study.
